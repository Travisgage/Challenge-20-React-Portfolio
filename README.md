## Description
The following is a simple portfolio built in React that caps off and summarizes my journey through this web development bootcamp. The goal is to offer a brief yet comprehensive look at my experience both pre- and post-bootcamp and to showcase a number of projects that demonstrate the skills I have developed and will continue to build on, as well as offering potential employers and colleagues in the field a sample of my personal style for aesthetics and front-end UI. The projects featured were chosen to reflect the variety of skills acquired throughout the course, including front- and back-end development incorporating a host of industry-standard technologies and frameworks.
